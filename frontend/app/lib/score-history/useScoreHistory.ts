// useScoreHistory reads a contract's score series from the adapter and
// applies the active range. The hook owns three pieces of UX subtlety the
// chart should not have to know about:
//
//   1. The effective range collapses to "all" when the dataset is shorter
//      than the requested window, so a brand new repo does not render an
//      empty 7d chart with a blank canvas.
//   2. The latest point and the prior point are surfaced together so the
//      tooltip can show the delta and the category that drove the change
//      without recomputing it on every hover.
//   3. The hook is async-aware: empty during load, then populated. Stories
//      and the dashboard branch on `isLoading` and `isEmpty` without
//      caring about Promise plumbing.
